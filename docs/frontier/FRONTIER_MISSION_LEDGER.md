# Project Frontier Mission Ledger

**Current stage:** isolated engine/API/UI plus immutable relationship review, bounded graph neighborhoods, and hash-verified public book/trade capture implemented; remaining acceptance work is substantial.
**Branch:** `codex/frontier-20261026`
**Worktree:** `/home/charlie/midas-frontier`
**Baseline:** `11d32a0693b25c290fd273f23e40cf7b5950d95d` (`codex/veritas-v6-integration-20261026`)
**Mode:** public read-only market research and virtual analysis. No trading credentials, wallet, deposits, withdrawals, order submission, production deployment, Reality restart, campaign mutation, or Atlas work.

## Baseline and preservation

- `/home/charlie/midas` was on `main` at `55601b9` with unrelated dirty work. It was not changed.
- `/home/charlie/midas-veritas-v6-integration-20261026` was clean at `11d32a0` and provided the integration baseline with Veritas V6 and Research Readiness.
- Inspected worktree heads included Reality `4f5cb568`, Veritas `3b102928`, Reality reliability `4278b5b5`, and the V6 integration baseline. The Reality reliability tree had unrelated dirty operational/evidence work and was not changed.
- `/home/charlie/midas-frontier` is a separate linked worktree on `codex/frontier-20261026`. Frontier uses its own store root and test roots.
- The mission-start handoff contained a dated low-headroom Reality/API sample. It was treated as a safety constraint, not as a capacity allowance. No Frontier process was attached to a protected service, and no production services or service configuration were changed.
- The initial ledger’s “active transient Veritas scope” statement was an unverified current-state claim. This ledger supersedes it; no campaign or scope status is inferred from it.

## Baseline architecture findings

- Legacy `Market`, `Instrument`, `Book`, and `Fee` models are Polymarket/CTF-oriented.
- `packages/midas/market_data/polymarket.py`, CTF checks, existing economics, Reality recording and Veritas V6 are reusable references, but do not themselves define exchange-neutral semantics.
- Existing recording/replay is single-source and strategy-specific. Frontier therefore uses separate models, SQLite evidence and deterministic replay.
- The React SPA and existing Mission Control styles support a native lazy-loaded Frontier page.

Genuine, unauthenticated GET response bodies are preserved under
`data/frontier/live-probes/`. The bounded captures contain five HTTP 200
responses: Kalshi market listing and a later book, Kraken AssetPairs and depth,
and Polymarket Gamma events. The sampled Kalshi order book was empty. The Kalshi
market carried MVE collection/selected-leg fields and is conservatively
classified as conditional with payoff unverified. The Polymarket “Kraken IPO”
event and Kraken XBT/USD spot are not equivalent payoffs. No verified
cross-venue pair, simultaneous market state, or economic opportunity was
established.

At `2026-10-26T20:41:18.904543Z`–`20:41:19.624016Z`, one actual public market
listing was requested through each Frontier API probe route using a temporary
8 MiB SQLite store, one request per venue, retries disabled, 65,536-byte response
caps, and no order-book calls. All three returned HTTP 200, normalized as
Polymarket `binary_event`, Kalshi `conditional_event`, and Kraken `spot_pair`,
were persisted, hash-verified on read-back, and returned by the market query.
The preserved capture envelope SHA-256 is
`3aaacd7b5d6f66d5cbc417f8ff14768bc3622378ada1a2ba7961cb705d58ab6a`. This check
also exposed and fixed the API’s omission of Kraken’s `instrument_metadata`
observations from market query and replay inputs.

At approximately `2026-10-26T21:10:40.775Z`–`21:10:43.974Z`, a second isolated
Frontier API validation made one public listing request and at most one public
book request for each venue, sequentially. It used an 8 MiB temporary store,
zero retries, an 8-second timeout, a 65,536-byte response cap, and a maximum of
two requests per source. All three API calls returned HTTP 200; each stored a
listing and one book. Polymarket's sampled book had 8 asks and 10 bids, Kraken
had 10 asks and 10 bids, and Kalshi's book was empty with no unified exchange
snapshot timestamp. Kraken reports per-level update times; Polymarket does not
establish matching-engine simultaneity. The captures were sequential, not a
synchronized multi-venue state. All six raw-body hashes and envelope hash
`101094b56c3dc620f8f66b423c92b5796db0a57852a5f7807aab50b2af956d60` were
recomputed successfully. No trades or fee endpoints were called.

At `2026-10-26T21:25:20.750899Z`–`21:25:27.005495Z`, a third isolated API
round trip requested one listing/metadata page, one book, and up to ten recent
trades per venue. Each adapter made three sequential HTTPS GET requests, all
HTTP 200. Polymarket and Kraken returned ten normalized trades; Kalshi returned
a valid empty public trade response. The API read-back matched those counts.
The 8 MiB temporary store was discarded after capture. All nine raw-body hashes
and envelope hash
`ca72a2aa2095ae02660f0ea23c0a6e94019929bd7d1e174b0446673637e04570` were
recomputed; largest body 68,758 bytes. These prints and sequential books do not
show synchronized quotes, executable fills, or fees. No fee endpoint was called.

Capture records and source-specific limitations are in
[`data/frontier/live-probes/README.md`](../../data/frontier/live-probes/README.md).

## Verification checkpoint

- Backend focused regression: **44 passed** in 8.12 seconds pytest time; one upstream Starlette/httpx TestClient deprecation warning. `/usr/bin/time -v` measured 8.87 seconds wall, 3.62 seconds user CPU, 141,224 KiB peak RSS, and zero socket messages.
- Ruff check and format check: passed across 17 relevant Frontier/API/test files.
- Mypy: passed for 15 Frontier/API source files.
- Frontend tests: **35 passed across 7 files**; typecheck, lint and Prettier check passed.
- Frontend production build: passed. Existing main and Chart chunks trigger Vite’s >500 kB warning. Frontier’s lazy chunks are 45.04 kB JS and 23.69 kB CSS.
- Frontier browser cases: **2 passed** in 6.2 seconds, including center-market graph navigation and fixture-only review submission at desktop/mobile sizes using one worker and isolated roots; source probes remained disabled. In the broader 10-case E2E run, 8 passed and 2 existing Laboratory cases were denied at the shared Arena resource-admission lock (`resource_admission_lock_busy`); no experiments started and the lock was not bypassed.
- The complete Python repository suite was not run. No continuous worker, campaign, or service was started.

## Completion matrix

| Component | Status | Current evidence / remaining requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Verified isolated baseline and worktree | COMPLETE AND VERIFIED | Separate branch from `11d32a0`; unrelated dirty trees preserved. |
| Adapter protocol, capability inventory, bounded GET transport | COMPLETE AND VERIFIED | Contract tests; all capabilities explicitly declared; no startup request. |
| Polymarket, Kalshi and Kraken Spot implementations | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Fixture tests and one bounded live listing/book/trade-to-store round trip per venue pass; fees and degraded-source paths remain unverified. |
| Canonical normalization and native evidence | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Distinct event, conditional event and spot forms; some semantics intentionally unverified. |
| Relationship matching, immutable review, and strict payoff verifier | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Self-attributed review API/UI with stored source refs, append-only revisions, compare-and-set, latest-state replay and migration tests; no authenticated reviewer/assertion or genuine equivalent pair. |
| Economic candidate verifier | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Exact two-venue binary all-long coverage only; synthetic construction tests are not market findings. |
| Bounded store and deterministic replay | COMPLETE AND VERIFIED | Schema v4, v2/v3 additive migration, append-only review/revision history, content integrity checks, and tests that later review revokes earlier verified replay input. |
| Frontier API and source configuration | COMPLETE AND VERIFIED | Local reads including hash-verified `/trades`, 1–3 hop graph route, explicit bounded writes, probes disabled by default, list-read integrity checks. |
| Live adapter-to-API listing, book, and trade persistence | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Three genuine listings, books, and trade responses preserved with raw/normalized data and verified hashes; Kalshi book/trade arrays were empty, and sources are sequential. |
| Mission Control Frontier workspace | IMPLEMENTED, LIVE VALIDATION PENDING | Native view, recorded trade table, and responsive E2E tested against isolated API; not deployed. |
| Laboratory/Arena research orchestration | DEFERRED | Navigation links only; no Frontier experiment job type/scheduler. |
| Persistent source collection, streaming and broad historical replay | DEFERRED | No background worker or long-duration campaign. |
| Cross-venue FX, comprehensive capital and settlement costs | DEFERRED | Unknown costs remain unknown and block decisive net economics. |
| Production eligibility/deployment | DEFERRED | Separate safety, resource, schema, operations review and authorization required. |
| Positive economic result | NOT ESTABLISHED | No verified live equivalent exposure or economically eligible candidate. |

## Blockers, risks, and next safe work

No defect blocks the implemented subset. The larger acceptance criteria remain
unfinished. Review labels and external assertion IDs are self-attributed and
not authenticated or fetched. The highest-value next steps are:

1. Extend source-failure, malformed-response, and fee-metadata checks; the new
   trades route is bounded but its multi-page behavior and degraded path need
   broader tests.
2. Add indexed/paginated graph adjacency and extend the UI with a bounded text-search drill-down.
3. Establish validated fee inputs before promoting any candidate to a decisive
   net classification.
4. Add multi-outcome mathematical checks and property/differential tests before
   broadening candidate search.
5. Design authenticated review and independent assertion ingestion only after a
   separately reviewed security boundary exists.
6. Integrate only short, resource-admitted deterministic replay jobs with
   Laboratory/Arena; do not start an unattended campaign.

Do not connect Frontier to Reality’s recorder, enable probes as a default,
deploy, or alter protected evidence as part of ordinary continuation. The next
safe work is source degradation and supported fee metadata validation, then
indexed graph adjacency and multi-outcome verification.
