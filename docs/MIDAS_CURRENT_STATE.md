# MIDAS current state

**Updated:** 2026-10-17 (local operational state). This is the current engineering and operations reference. Mission reports, checkpoints, ledgers, and experiment artifacts remain historical records and should be read with their own version and capture time.

## Project status

Prometheus, Reality, and Veritas engineering is consolidated into `main`. Prometheus provides the simulation, Laboratory, Arena, provenance, and bounded research foundations. Reality provides public read-only market recording, replay, and forward shadow campaigns. Veritas provides versioned market observation, independent audits, economic sensitivities, source replay, Arena qualification, and the dashboard/API.

MIDAS has no real-order, wallet, deposit, or trading-credential path. Public observations, shadow campaigns, and Arena/Laboratory simulations do not establish real fills or profitability.

## Repository and worktrees

| Path | Branch | Purpose and dependency |
|---|---|---|
| `/home/charlie/midas` | `main` | Authoritative development checkout. Main API, dashboard, and Arena scheduler run from here. |
| `/home/charlie/midas-reality` | `project/reality` | Retained runtime checkout for the public recorder, frozen Reality campaign, successor campaign, and Reality interface. Systemd units use this path; its `data/` and `.venv/` stay local. |
| `/home/charlie/midas-veritas` | `project/veritas` | Retained data and runtime workspace for Veritas observation, source replay, gap-detail replay, Research Director, and Veritas API artifacts. Timers use this path; its ignored data remains local. |

Both feature branch histories are represented in `main`. The Reality and Veritas worktrees remain because active services and preserved runtime data depend on their paths. Do not remove either worktree until those services and their data have a separately verified migration plan. Temporary consolidation worktrees are not part of the operating layout.

Recovery refs created during consolidation:

- `recovery/preconsolidation-main-20261017`
- `recovery/preconsolidation-reality-20261017`
- `recovery/preconsolidation-veritas-20261017`
- `recovery/veritas-uncommitted-20261017` (preserved interrupted Veritas changes)

Project Atlas and Frontier are not implemented and are deferred.

## Architecture and source layout

MIDAS is a Python modular monolith with a separate React dashboard:

- `packages/midas/core`, `market_data`, `simulation`, `risk`, and `paper` contain the domain, read-only adapters, deterministic exchange, and virtual accounting.
- `packages/midas/laboratory` and `packages/midas/arena` contain durable simulated experiments and bounded research jobs.
- `packages/midas/reality` contains public recording, finalized-segment replay, and shadow-campaign code.
- `packages/midas/veritas` contains observation, source replay, measurement, audit, and economic analysis.
- `apps/api` registers the FastAPI routes and configures persistence and storage paths.
- `apps/web` contains the React command center, including Arena, Reality, and Veritas pages.
- `docs/` contains current operations guidance plus preserved historical research, checkpoint, provenance, and verification records.

The Veritas API uses source code from `main` and reads its versioned documents and runtime artifacts from `MIDAS_VERITAS_WORKSPACE` (currently `/home/charlie/midas-veritas`). This keeps the 122 MB observatory and 133 MB Arena runtime stores in place. The main Arena store remains `/home/charlie/midas/data/arena` unless `MIDAS_ARENA_ROOT` is changed.

## Services and dashboard access

The active local dashboard and API use loopback addresses:

- Main command center: <http://127.0.0.1:5173>
- Main API health: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health>
- Veritas overview: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/veritas/overview>
- Reality API: <http://127.0.0.1:8010/api/health>
- Reality interface: <http://127.0.0.1:5180>

The main API and web development server use `/home/charlie/midas`. Reality recorder, shadow workers, API, and web services use `/home/charlie/midas-reality`. Veritas timer units use `/home/charlie/midas-veritas`; Veritas observation, source replay, gap-detail replay, and Research Director services are one-shot jobs and are normally inactive between timer runs. `midas-arena-scheduler.timer` also runs bounded dispatch checks; its service is normally inactive after each check.

As of this update, the Reality recorder is running with `MemoryHigh=704 MiB` and `MemoryMax=768 MiB`; observed use was about 698 MiB. It is close to the configured high threshold. Do not raise the limit to hide growth. The frozen Reality worker is still running but is severely behind source input; its campaign is preserved and unchanged. The successor worker is active on its own versioned campaign. Both report zero actual orders.

The frozen worker's last status showed `WARMING_OR_LAGGED_SOURCE`, 10,253 decisions, and 215,099 lagged frames skipped. Its last decision was at 2026-10-15 08:58 UTC while the status was updated at 2026-10-16 22:40 UTC. The successor status was `FORWARD_EVALUATING_EXPERIMENTAL`, with its last decision and source receipt near 2026-10-16 22:40 UTC. Do not restart, reset, reconfigure, or rewrite either campaign as part of routine deployment.

The last completed Veritas gap-detail run processed 7,354 replayable finalized segments from a 7,356-segment catalog; the remaining two were recorded as empty finalized segments, with no pending source bytes. The latest source-analysis summary reported 7,306 processed of 7,306 catalog segments and no pending source bytes; a scheduled run was in progress at the time of inspection. The latest public observation scan completed at 00:30 local time.

Historical failed one-shot Arena jobs, test suites, capture attempts, and the Reality canary remain visible in systemd's failed-unit list. They are not active processes or recurring timers. Do not clear or rerun them just to make the unit list look clean; consult their saved records and logs first.

## Data and archive locations

Mutable databases, model files, recordings, campaign state, and research runtime outputs are ignored by Git and must remain in place:

- Prometheus and main application state: `/home/charlie/midas/data/` (about 5.3 GB), including Arena and Laboratory stores.
- Reality recordings: `/home/charlie/midas-reality/data/recordings/` (about 3.4 GB); Reality research and campaigns: `/home/charlie/midas-reality/data/research/` (about 1.7 GB).
- Frozen Reality campaign: `/home/charlie/midas-reality/data/research/reality/forward/mission2/`.
- Successor campaign: `/home/charlie/midas-reality/data/research/reality/forward/mission2-successor-20261016/`.
- Veritas finalized-source observations and summaries: `/home/charlie/midas-veritas/data/veritas-observatory/` (about 122 MB); Veritas Arena store: `/home/charlie/midas-veritas/data/arena/` (about 133 MB).
- Recovery snapshots: `/home/charlie/midas-recovery-20261011T2355/` and `/home/charlie/midas-recovery-post-campaign-20261012/` (about 480 MB and 504 MB). Each snapshot manifest listed 47 files; all recorded sizes and SHA-256 values verified.
- Prometheus bundles: `/home/charlie/midas-prometheus-bundles/` (about 555 MB). All 24 `.tar.gz` archives passed a read-only archive listing/integrity check. Related bundle verification records remain in `docs/`.

The frozen Reality campaign configuration SHA-256 is `aa8acb2b46823c1a1e3ac5d01a57dde917746c2c7471098ae2a4598875e322f5`; the successor configuration SHA-256 is `c5eb8b98cbfd657372fc620192c5a0c0bb46f41d760800e680181fa7f3ee95a3`. A read-only integrity check verified both campaign identities, 20 pinned code files, four models, SQLite integrity, and event chains. The frozen journal had 113,419 events and tail SHA-256 `0d4757d1bb9d9145c90ce1ce004943dcb1c733da18617ec2a844444591a279e`; the successor had 23,657 events and tail SHA-256 `59475db679ae4c2ce8e3fe464d76046d1dde337ae07861110662c97d373f9921`. These checks did not write to the campaign directories.

## Research conclusions and evidence limits

- Prometheus demonstrated model and policy behavior in synthetic simulation. It did not establish real-market profitability.
- Reality's frozen forward state remains `insufficient_forward_evidence`; no scientific champion or real fill is established.
- The latest ledger-receipted Veritas independent audit covers 84 saved scans and 3,360 selected observations. It reports zero quality-valid positive gross candidates, zero stored-versus-independent validity/top-edge mismatches, and zero disagreements across 3,768 fee checks. The sample is finite, selected, and correlated; it is not venue-wide or evidence of fills.
- The market-quality experiment predicts the same-snapshot book-quality gate only. It reports zero positive gross candidates in its held-out panel and is explicitly not deployed as an economic strategy.
- `VERITAS_MISSION2_INDEPENDENT_OPPORTUNITY_AUDIT_021.json` contains an 85-scan result but has no matching ledger receipt. It is preserved as unreceipted evidence and is not the artifact returned by the dashboard. The API intentionally serves the newest ledger-receipted audit (scan 84).

No historical observation, campaign journal, or economic result should be rewritten to make versions agree. Synthetic execution sensitivities, public quote observations, and shadow decisions must remain distinct.

## Development and verification

From `/home/charlie/midas`, use Python 3.12+, Node 22+, Corepack, and the lockfiles. See [Development and verification](DEVELOPMENT.md) for full install instructions.

```bash
uv sync --frozen
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
.venv/bin/uv run uvicorn apps.api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
corepack pnpm dev
```

The main backend tests are run with `.venv/bin/uv run --frozen pytest -q`; frontend checks use `corepack pnpm lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and `build`. Browser tests use `corepack pnpm test:e2e`. Tests that admit Arena jobs or start campaigns can write durable state; use a temporary data root for intentional tests and inspect the command before running it.

For focused Veritas regression tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=packages .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_veritas_*.py
```

## Deferred work and operating limits

The frozen worker's lag and recorder memory growth need a separately versioned operational decision. Preserve the current campaigns, records, and source segments while making that decision. Do not change the frozen campaign configuration or journal. Atlas/Frontier, new market discovery, strategy expansion, training, exploratory experiments, and economic optimization are outside the current maintenance scope.
