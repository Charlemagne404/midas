# Veritas Mission 2 Operations

**Runtime checked:** 2026-10-15 15:16:48 UTC
**Services:** `midas-veritas-observatory.service`, `midas-veritas-source-analysis.service`, `midas-veritas-research-director.service`
**Timers:** `midas-veritas-observatory.timer`, `midas-veritas-source-analysis.timer`, `midas-veritas-research-director.timer`

## Current state

- All three Veritas user timers are active. Scan 23 finalized at 15:00:26 UTC, the finalized-source replay exited at 15:14:31 UTC, and the Director cycle exited at 15:15:37 UTC. Arena completed its qualification at 15:15:47 UTC. The next scheduled UTC runs are 15:30:10, 15:40:45, and 15:45:00. The oneshot services are inactive between runs as expected.
- Latest scan: `scan-20261015T150026Z-56e1e44d7837`, captured at 15:00:26 UTC and finalized under v4. The analyzer has 23 processed snapshots and no pending snapshots. The cumulative panel has 920 selected observations, 825 request/receipt-valid pairs, 95 invalid pairs, 418 distinct market IDs, and 189 pairs passing the prior reported-age/skew gate. The paired increase is 636/920 (+69.13 percentage points); all five economic gates remain zero-positive.
- The latest six-frame bounded discovery union contains 300 unique IDs: 190 supported same-condition V1 binary pairs and 110 explicit exclusions (84 augmented NegRisk records and 26 unsupported outcome relationships). The selected panel has 40 markets, 36 rotating and four available frozen controls. Scan 23 overlaps scan 22 on five IDs, one rotating and four controls, so 35 rotating selections changed. Liquidity counts are 15 high / 11 medium / 14 low; expiry counts are 19 near / 14 medium / 7 long; spread counts are 21 tight / 14 medium / 5 wide.
- Runtime data uses 21,785,641 bytes under `data/veritas-observatory/`, below the 1 GiB hard cap. Snapshots and derived runtime artifacts are ignored by Git; versioned docs record identities and hashes. Do not prune or raise the cap without a separate retention review.
- The 15:00 v2 scan used seven HTTP attempts (six Gamma frames and one CLOB batch) out of a 14-attempt maximum. Thirty-six selected pairs passed the quality gate; four had empty No ask sides. The frozen control file hash remains `9578217e20dcc7d1c65fa110f0ed7c689b55483b61191f1aae8d30c9b7300d9a`.
- The finalized Reality source analyzer remains `catching_up_finalized_source`: 2,161 of 3,668 cataloged finalized segments processed, with 1,507 segments / 396,434,833 bytes pending through ordinal 269,843. The 15:10 UTC recurrence processed 124 segments / 33,163,975 bytes in 227 seconds, using 11.36 CPU seconds and 155,504,640 bytes peak memory. Its partial prefix contains 70,950 campaign-window frame records, 59,343 touched market-frame states, and 57,798 quality-valid states, with zero positive top-ask and full-depth states. Summary digest: `37715a41a176feb08db23867b5f2c7b9e39647a3f9df43a770df049c497dd6e3`; summary file SHA256: `08bd70741083b0d689c8df5d3bdf9b3fbee7683670261fea5932dbaccba6199a`. The 12:43 source-window interpretation correction is recorded in [Gate A checkpoint 017](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_A_CHECKPOINT_017.md).
- The 15:15 Director cycle reconciled scan 22, then admitted `job-bf0dbe4c773f4cfe9832fd8d` for scan 23 using the 15:14 source summary. Arena completed all 23 events at 15:15:47 UTC; finding `veritas-qualification-v1-a695104c7dcbb82a` reports zero positive states at all five gates. The Director manifest last updated at 15:15:32 UTC projects `QUEUED` for scan 23 and retains scan 22's finding, while its event archive records scan 22 completion and scan 23 admission. The next scheduled cycle at 15:45:00 UTC is the reconciliation point. No manual poll or retry was started. See [Gate F checkpoint 011](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_F_CHECKPOINT_011.md).
- At 11:30 CEST an observer run failed with `Invalid frozen control cohort` because the deployed scanner rejected the file's legacy version tag. The frozen file remained unchanged, current code accepts both tags, and scheduled scans through 17:00 CEST succeeded. No manual recovery scan was run.
- The protected Reality user services were active during the last explicit read-only check. The separate Reality worktree was clean. No Reality service was restarted or modified, and no campaign data was changed.

## Research Director history projection

The `/api/arena/research-activity` projection now includes a digest-checked
history of each displayed Director's recent events. It scans at most 128
event files per Director, reads at most 64 KiB per event, and returns up to
eight records. The API verifies each event filename against the canonical
payload digest and confirms the Director identity before projecting selected
fields. It does not alter Director manifests or events. The last read-only
projection check at 12:55 UTC returned eight verified entries from the
Director's then-19-file event archive, marked the view truncated, and reported
zero invalid artifacts. The full append-only event directory remains the durable record; the UI and API
history are bounded views. See [Gate G checkpoint
004](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_G_CHECKPOINT_004.md).

## Resource and network bounds

| Control | Configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Cohort size | 40 selected markets; service validates 30–50 |
| Stable controls | Target 8; unavailable frozen IDs are reported, not outcome-replaced |
| Discovery | Six Gamma query frames, at most 50 returned rows per frame; rotating 30-minute page offsets |
| Book reads | One public CLOB `/books` batch for selected pair assets |
| Request pacing | One second between public requests; seven logical reads planned, 14 HTTP attempts maximum |
| CPU | `CPUQuota=5%`, `Nice=19` |
| Memory | `MemoryMax=256M` |
| Storage | 1 GiB observatory root cap; scanner fails closed at projected bound |
| Runtime | 10-minute systemd start timeout |
| Privileges | `NoNewPrivileges=true`; no credentials or authenticated requests |
| Director cycle | Timer at :15 and :45 UTC; skips evidence older than two hours; one scan-pinned Arena admission |
| Director service | CPU 5%, memory 512 MiB, private temp, `AF_UNIX` socket family only |
| Qualification job | CPU quota 10%, memory 512 MiB, wall 300 seconds, source cap 64 MiB / 512 events, `AF_UNIX` only |
| Write access | Veritas observatory and this checkout's isolated `data/arena` roots only |

The observer uses public Gamma GET discovery and unauthenticated public CLOB reads. It makes no orders and has no wallet, deposit, or authenticated trading path. Request/receipt timing does not prove response-batch atomicity, venue sequence, upstream queue age, or executable quote lifetime.

## Data lifecycle and versioning

The scanner writes exclusive, content-hashed compressed snapshots. `continuous_analysis.py` verifies finalized snapshot identities and immutable event digests, then atomically updates analyzer state and summary. It accepts at most 100 pending snapshots per run and rejects malformed, oversized, digest-mismatched, or unsafe inputs. v4 records paired legacy/current gate outcomes and per-market sample coverage. Snapshot fingerprint changes are sampled inter-scan changes, not true venue update rates.

The one-shot NegRisk studies cover the complete nine-outcome Strava set and a
second seven-market OpenAI IPO group. The OpenAI group was enumerated by seven
direct Gamma market reads and checked against the adapter's on-chain question
count; the Gamma group filter returned 20 unrelated rows and no matching
members. A second CLOB refresh and a public WebSocket cross-check each returned
all 14 books. Both source captures failed the 5-second age and 250 ms skew
rules. The WebSocket top prices and last-trade prices matched the REST response
for all tokens, while full displayed depth changed and the stream supplied no
sequence field. The new stream replay runner verifies the saved frame and its
REST reference. These fixed-group reads remain separate from the recurring
observer timer. See [Gate A checkpoint
016](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_A_CHECKPOINT_016.md).

## Previous Gate A checkpoint 019 — evidence at 14:21 UTC

The 14:01 UTC scan finalized as snapshot 21. The v4 panel contains 840
selected observations, 751 quality-valid pairs, 89 invalid pairs, 176 legacy
age/skew-valid pairs, and 367 distinct markets. The paired yield increase is
575/840 (68.45 percentage points). All five economic gates remain
zero-positive. Scan 21's bounded union has 300 unique IDs, 198 supported
pairs, and 102 explicit exclusions; its 40-market sample retained 37 rotating
markets and three available frozen controls.

The 14:13 finalized-source summary contains 40,459 campaign-window frame
records, 30,809 touched states, and 29,749 quality-valid states. The prefix
remains incomplete with 1,630 finalized segments / 430,839,649 bytes pending;
positive top-ask and full-depth counts remain zero. The earlier 12:43 summary
contained 4,078 campaign-window frames; checkpoint 016's interpretation of
that counter as zero frames was incorrect and was corrected in checkpoint 017.

The 14:15 Director cycle recorded completion of scan 20 and admitted scan 21.
Arena completed all 21 events at 14:16:20 UTC, but the manifest still showed
`QUEUED` for scan 21 and scan 20 as last qualified at this check. The next
Director cycle at 14:45:16 UTC is the scheduled reconciliation point. See
[Gate A checkpoint 019](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_A_CHECKPOINT_019.md), [Gate F checkpoint
009](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_F_CHECKPOINT_009.md), and [research inventory
022](VERITAS_MISSION2_RESEARCH_INVENTORY_022.json).

## Previous Gate A checkpoint 018 — scan 20 evidence

The 13:31 UTC scan finalized as snapshot 20. The v4 panel contains 800
selected observations, 714 quality-valid pairs, 86 invalid pairs, 167 legacy
age/skew-valid pairs, and 349 distinct markets. The paired yield increase is
547/800 (68.38 percentage points). All five economic gates remain
zero-positive. Scan 20's bounded union has 297 unique IDs, 153 supported
pairs, and 144 explicit exclusions; its 40-market sample retained 37 rotating
markets and three available frozen controls.

The 13:43 finalized-source summary contains 29,198 campaign-window frame
records, 21,747 touched states, and 21,041 quality-valid states. The prefix
remains incomplete with 1,699 finalized segments / 450,044,085 bytes pending;
positive top-ask and full-depth counts remain zero. The earlier 12:43 summary
contained 4,078 campaign-window frames; checkpoint 016's interpretation of
that counter as zero frames was incorrect and was corrected in checkpoint 017.

The 13:45 Director admission completed all 20 events in Arena, but its
manifest still showed `QUEUED` and scan 19 as last qualified at this check.
The next Director cycle at 14:15:29 UTC is the scheduled reconciliation
point. See [Gate A checkpoint 018](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_A_CHECKPOINT_018.md),
[Gate F checkpoint 008](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_F_CHECKPOINT_008.md), and
[research inventory 021](VERITAS_MISSION2_RESEARCH_INVENTORY_021.json).

## Gate A checkpoint 016 — historical evidence


The 12:31 UTC observer scan remains finalized as snapshot 18. It has 32
quality-valid pairs and eight empty-ask invalid pairs; the cumulative panel has
645/720 quality-valid pairs across 304 distinct markets. All five economic
qualification gates remain zero-positive. The 12:45 Arena qualification
completed all 18 analysis events and found no positive gross state.

The OpenAI IPO stream capture returned a complete 14-token book set in 84 ms,
but its source age reached 17.781 seconds and source timestamp skew was 11.977
seconds. Best bid, best ask, and last-trade prices matched the REST refresh for
14/14 tokens. The current stream schema provides no sequence field, so the
capture does not establish independent sequence freshness. See [Gate A
checkpoint 016](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_A_CHECKPOINT_016.md), [Gate F checkpoint
006](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_F_CHECKPOINT_006.md), and [inventory
019](VERITAS_MISSION2_RESEARCH_INVENTORY_019.json).

The finalized-source summary referenced by checkpoint 016 contains 4,078
campaign-window frame records, 2,779 touched market-frame states, and 2,739
quality-valid states. Top-ask and full-depth positive counts remain zero, and
the source prefix remains incomplete with finalized segments pending.

The independent Reality source analyzer validates the frozen campaign identity and reads only cataloged finalized `.seg` inputs. It never opens `.open` files. Per run it is limited to 128 segments or 32 MiB of new segment data; each segment is capped at 16 MiB. Catalog scans are bounded. Source state and events retain campaign/code/prefix digests and stop on identity drift. Resource bounds remain CPU 5%, memory 256 MiB, low priority, ten-minute timeout, and Veritas-only writes.

Arena's existing job worker supports a pinned, bounded Veritas qualification task. The recurring Director detects each new finalized v4 scan, checks readiness, admits one idempotent job, verifies the finding digest and source lineage, and reports an evidence-based recommendation. It also validates and records the separate finalized-source summary; it does not coordinate or launch source replay, start strategy/model experiments, or promote a model. See [Gate F checkpoints 001](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_F_CHECKPOINT_001.md) and [002](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_F_CHECKPOINT_002.md).

## Frozen campaign censoring snapshot

At 08:44 UTC the Gate C analyzer captured 10,165 decisions from one read-only
SQLite transaction. It used `mode=ro` and `PRAGMA query_only=on`; it did not copy
raw observations. The artifact contains 40,660 horizon slots, 930 observed
public measurements, 39,730 censors, and zero pending outcomes in that snapshot.
The campaign writer remains active, so this is an interim view.
`future_observation_unavailable` remains unresolved between quiet venue
activity and feed/cohort coverage. The full event hash chain and a full database
integrity check were not run. See [Gate C checkpoint
001](VERITAS_MISSION2_GATE_C_CHECKPOINT_001.md).

Do not launch overlapping manual runs. If a manual run is needed, invoke its oneshot service and wait for completion before reading the relevant summary.

## Preservation

The separate `/home/charlie/midas-reality` checkout remains the protected source of the frozen campaign. Veritas analysis reads finalized source segments only and writes to its own observatory root. Do not restart or alter Reality services for this workflow. No Arena, Laboratory, Prometheus, or historical campaign records are rewritten. No real-money action is permitted.
